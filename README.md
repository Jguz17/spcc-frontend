# Superior Pristine Cleaning Company Frontend

This repo holds an admin dashboard and a client site for regular users. I used html, css, and bootstrap for this project.

I built this site for a client who needed a better way to manager her cleaning business.

A normal user can visit the live version at: https://superiorpristinecleaningcompany.netlify.app/.

The client site allows a regular user to send a message to the spcc dashboard and also submit a booking request.

To access the admin panel, you can go to: https://superiorpristinecleaningcompany.netlify.app/admin.

Use the following credentials to mess around with the app:

email: admin@gmail.com
password: 123456

## Installation

After you have cloned this repo, in your cli run: 

```bash
npm install -g live-server

live-server
```

This will open up the frontend!

## Usage

I made this app for the client because they needed something more efficient than their standard client management.
